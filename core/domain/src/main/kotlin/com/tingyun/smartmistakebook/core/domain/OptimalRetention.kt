/**
 * CMRR-style desired-retention recommendation (研究 2026-09-09 §5; the objective
 * follows fsrs-rs `simulation.rs`'s `CMRRTargetFn`: minimize cost per memorized
 * card). For each candidate retention target it simulates every card forward
 * over a fixed horizon, accumulating the expected retrievability ("memorized")
 * and the number of reviews ("cost"), and returns the target with the lowest
 * cost per memorized card.
 *
 * This is a **simplified** simulator, not a port of fsrs-rs's deck scheduler:
 * it models only the long-run review stream of the cards the learner already
 * has (no new-card introduction, no learning steps, no per-rating cost table).
 * It models the lapse force (研究 2026-09-10): each review succeeds with
 * probability R; on failure the expected cost includes [LAPSE_RECOVERY_REVIEWS]
 * relearning review(s) and the expected stability averages the grown and
 * collapsed branches. Without this force the cost/memorized curve is monotone
 * decreasing and the optimum degenerates to the retention floor, which would
 * push every learner toward the highest-forgetting regime.
 *
 * It therefore reports an *experimental* recommendation, and returns null
 * whenever the data is too thin to be meaningful. Card sets dominated by
 * still-learning items (very low stability) can still read at the floor — the
 * relearning force for such cards is under-modelled — so the readout is
 * trusted most for learners with a graduated review deck.
 *
 * 消灭的失败：此前只有一个手动的保持率滑杆，学生没有任何基于自己真实记忆
 * 状态的取值参考。
