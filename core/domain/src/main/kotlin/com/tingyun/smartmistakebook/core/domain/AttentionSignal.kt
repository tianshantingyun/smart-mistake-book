 * Attention-diversion discount (spec mastery-scheduling §2.14): switching

 * 1996: divided attention at encoding severely impairs later memory; Sana
 * et al. 2013: multitasking hinders learning) and signals difficulty or
 * aversion (D'Mello et al. 2013: mind-wandering rises with text difficulty
 * and its rate predicts comprehension).
 *
 * The factor only ever discounts the evidence weight of the current attempt
 * — it never enters the forgetting curve itself. The coefficients are
 * engineering priors pending calibration from review_log data; the shape
 * (per-extra-switch penalty plus a milder cumulative away-time penalty, both
 * floored) follows the resumption-cost literature (Trafton et al. 2005).
