/**
 * Knowledge-node-grained mastery reads for the tutor's `MASTERY_READ` tool.
 *
 * Why this exists next to the `knowledge_question_lattice` view: the lattice is
 * **question-grained** (one row per binding), so counting its rows counts
 * bindings rather than knowledge nodes and the same node appears once per bound
 * question. The tool needs a node-grained view of the same facts plus the
 * aggregate history behind each node, and it needs them **scoped to one
 * subject** — the tool must never widen disclosure past the current subject.
 *
 * The projection name is the same literal the `library_catalog` and
 * `knowledge_question_lattice` views already pin, rather than a parameter:
 * there is exactly one production projection and inventing a second place to
 * carry the constant would just create a way for the two to disagree. Every
 * caller-supplied value (`learnerId`, `subject`, `knowledgeNodeIds`) is bound.
